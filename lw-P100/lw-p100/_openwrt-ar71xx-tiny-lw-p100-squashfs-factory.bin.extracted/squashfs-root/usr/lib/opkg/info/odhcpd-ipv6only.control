Description:  odhcpd is a daemon for serving and relaying IP management protocols to
 configure clients and downstream routers. It tries to follow the RFC 6204
 requirements for IPv6 home routers.
 
 This is a variant providing server services for RA, stateless and stateful
 DHCPv6,  prefix delegation and can be used to relay RA, DHCPv6 and NDP between
 routed (non-bridged) interfaces in case no delegated prefixes are available.
